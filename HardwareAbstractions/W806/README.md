Hardware abstraction for the W806 microcontroller. Haven't tested it but probably works with W801 microcontroller as well. 

An implementation example can be found here https://github.com/FL0WL0W/EFIGenieW806
For setting up the W806 toolchain and SDK follow the SDK guide https://github.com/IOsetting/wm-sdk-w806/tree/d2625afdaad56222a91b61461f392b1623181409

Build environment tested was using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with csky toolchain included in the environment path. a CMakePresets.json can be found in the EFIGenieW806 repository which shows the toolchain command line args.

Translated documentation is included in this folder. Translation was done using Google Translate.
